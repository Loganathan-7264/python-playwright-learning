Day 4 â€“ Match, Range & Loops in Python
ðŸ”¹ Match Statement

Works like a switch in other languages.

Helps avoid long if...elif...else chains.

Syntax:

match expression:
    case value1:
        # code
    case value2:
        # code
    case _:
        # default (if nothing matches)


How it works:

Expression is checked once.

Compared with each case.

Runs the matching block.

ðŸ”¹ range() Function

Used to generate a sequence of numbers.

Syntax: range(start, stop, step)

start â†’ default 0

stop â†’ exclusive (not included)

step â†’ default 1 (can be negative too)

ðŸ”¹ Looping Statements

While Loop â€“ Runs as long as condition is True.

while condition:
    # code


For Loop â€“ Runs a fixed number of times (mostly with range()).

for i in range(start, stop, step):
    # code

ðŸ”¹ Jumping Statements

break â†’ exits the loop immediately.

continue â†’ skips the current iteration, moves to next.
